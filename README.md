# Final-Network-Configuration-Lab
Enterprise network lab with VLANs, NAT, ACLs, and routing (Packet Tracer)
# Final Network Configuration Lab

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The lab includes VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, NAT (Static & PAT), ACL-based security, and server access control.

## 🧠 Technologies & Concepts
- IP Subnetting (/28, /27)
- VLANs (10, 20, 30)
- Router-on-a-Stick
- Static Routing
- NAT (Static & PAT)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Web & FTP Servers
- Network Security Best Practices

## 🗺 Network Components
- 4 Routers (Core & Edge)
- Multiple Switches
- VLAN-based user segmentation
- Internet simulation
- Public-facing servers (Static NAT)

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Final-Network-Lab.pkt` – Packet Tracer topology
- `Network-Documentation.md` – Full technical documentation
- `Screenshots/` – Verification and testing proof

## ✅ Project Status
✔ Completed  
✔ Tested  
✔ Verified

## 🧪 Verification
All configurations were tested using:
- ping
- traceroute
- show ip route
- show ip nat translations
- show access-lists
